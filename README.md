## 📖 Overview
This project introduces a **gesture-controlled UAV navigation system** using **real-time vision-based fist detection**.  
By integrating **MediaPipe** for gesture tracking and **DroneKit-Python** with **ArduPilot SITL**, the system enables drones to turn left, right, or continue forward based on a user’s hand position.  
This approach eliminates the need for handheld controllers, providing a **low-cost**, **intuitive**, and **hands-free** way to navigate drones.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Enable **real-time gesture-based UAV control** using a live webcam feed.  
- Implement **DroneKit-ArduPilot** communication for guided-mode flight.  
- Achieve **smooth, stable navigation** without GPS jumps.  
- Create a **lightweight, portable system** for educational and practical UAV use.

## 🧩 Methodology

### 1. Video Frame Capture
- Live webcam input is streamed via **Iriun Webcam**, simulating mobile camera usage.

### 2. Frame Preprocessing
- Frames resized and converted using **OpenCV** to optimize for speed and clarity.

### 3. Gesture Recognition
- **MediaPipe Hand Tracking** detects hand landmarks.
- A rule-based classifier identifies **closed-fist gestures**.
- The camera frame is divided into zones:
  - **Left Zone →** Drone turns right  
  - **Center/Right Zone →** Drone turns left  
  - **No Fist Detected →** Drone continues forward

### 4. UAV Control
- **DroneKit-Python** commands UAV heading adjustments using MAVLink protocol.
- Operates in **GUIDED mode** for controlled and stable simulation.

### 5. Real-Time Loop
- Continuous 60-second control cycle:
  - Reads camera input → Detects gesture → Sends command → Moves forward
- Ends with a **safe landing sequence**.
